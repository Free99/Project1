# Project1
-This application was created as a solution for users giving away furniture and users looking for free furniture. 
- The user that is giving away furniture will create a listing with furniture specifications, contact information and location.
- The user needing furniture will search for free furniture within specific zip codes. That user can then read through listings within their zip code search and contact the user giving away furniture with the contact information that is on the listing.
